# Weed Rotation Tracker
A little program I made for me and my friends when we're passing around the
bong to keep track of whose hit it is. Because as you may know, weed makes you
likely to lose track of time and get lost in the cosmos, man~

## Usage
To use the weed rotation tracker, first you must compile it. Clone this repo
to your local drive, and just run `make`. Out should pop a little executable
called `weedtracker`.

Once it's compiled, you can run the application with `./weedtracker`, followed
by the names of every person you want to be in the rotation. Additionally, you
can add the `-r` as the FIRST parameter, and it'll randomize who takes their
hit when. Otherwise, it'll just have them in the order in which they were
inputted.

## Disclaimer
I am not responsible for any green-outs that may occur from the usage of herbal
substances as a result of using this program. You're an adult (I hope), and
are responsible for whatever chemicals you decide to put into your body.
If you're gonna do it anyway, here's the program to help! :D
